I am currently studying data science at the University of Pisa. I love to solve problems. Currently looking for an opportunity where I am challenged and gain experience. Currently sharpening my skills in python and data science so that I can provide real actionable insight for change. 

### Why is blog?

As I am learning data science I find myself in different problems sometimes I find myself a good answer. Then not save it in a good place and cannot find it again, so I have created this blog so if any one else have same problems then can get a solution here.
